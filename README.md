# Sharetribe's Design Resources

The Sharetribe Web Template designs are available as Sketch and Figma files. You can speed up your process by using the design files to customize the existing marketplace design or use it as a base to create your own. 

## Variations

The template supports multiple transaction processes and layout options that differ slightly in UI and UX. To switch between options, expand the "⚠️ VARIATIONS" folder and toggle folders according to your preferred marketplace configurations and layouts. 

## Good-to-know

- You can find the design files in both Figma and Sketch formats. You can open these files in most common UI Design apps.
- Components and styles: The design files are composed of multiple components. You can edit components globally and overwrite them locally. Typography and color schemes are defined as styles that you can use for global and local components.
